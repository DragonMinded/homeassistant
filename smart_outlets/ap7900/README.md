Configuration YAML template for an APC AP7900. You will want to substitute your unit's IP instead of `<ip>` and your unit's outlet number (1-8) instead of `<outlet>`. Note that this requires SNMP utilities to be installed in your Home Assistant container. Note also that this requires you to enable SNMPv1 on your AP7900, and that the read community be set to "public" and the write community be set to "private".
