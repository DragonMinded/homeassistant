Configuration YAML template and helper scripts for a Synaccess NP-02B. You will want to substitute your unit's IP instead of `<ip>` and your unit's outlet number (1-2) instead of `<outlet>`. Note that this requires the "requests" library to be installed in your Home Assistant's virtualenv or system python. Note also that this assumes the default admin/admin username and password combo to the web UI. You should place the scripts in the home directory if your Home Assistant installation or change the command to be absolute instead of relative in order to point at the scripts.
